# WolrdWise: an interactive Travel Diary app!

Original project designed by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann), as part of his [Ultimate React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/). I followed his design and built this project to practice core React concepts.

## Live Version

Available [here on Netlify](https://usepopcorn-tsm13.netlify.app/).

### Project Features

- Users can pick a location on the map, or let the app pick their location based on their current coordinates.

### Main technical concepts applied in this project:

- State management with `useReducer` and `Context API`.
- `React Router` library was used for routing throughout the app.
- `useCallback`
- `CSS modules` library was used for styling the app.
- `Geolocation`
- Leaflet's Map API.

### Notes

- Built with Vite.
- Not 100% optimized for small screens, since the goal of this project was to practice mainly React/JS features, but it should be mobile-friendly enough.
